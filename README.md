Speculative Design Reports – Information Systems Context

This repository contains the Speculative Design reports produced by participants in a research study investigating how diverse Speculative Design methods are created, adapted, and applied within Information Systems (IS) design contexts.

The reports serve as the primary empirical material for the study and include self-developed methods, individual instantiations, and cross-instantiations used to explore future-oriented sociotechnical challenges.

Purpose of the Repository

The goal of this repository is to:

Provide transparency and replicability for the empirical analysis reported in the study

Document how different Speculative Design methods were constructed and applied by IS design actors

Enable reuse of the material for research, teaching, and methodological reflection

Support comparative analysis of methodological choices, limitations, and outcomes

This repository is intended for researchers and practitioners in Information Systems, HCI, Design Science, and Future-Oriented Design.
